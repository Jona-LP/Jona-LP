# _JONA-LP_

## _Hi coder fellows!_ 👋

As a mathematician, I am currently transitioning into the field of data science. I believe that my background in mathematics will serve as a solid foundation for data analysis and modeling. With my passion for problem-solving and data-driven decision making, I am eager to make meaningful contributions to the field of data science.
